This repository provides datasets, density functional theory output files (QChem 5.4.1-5.4.2), and original codes (Python and MATLAB) that support the results presented in a submitted manuscript entitled:

"The Roles of Hydroxyl Radicals and Superoxide in Oxidizing Aqueous Benzyl Alcohol under Ultrasound Irradiation."


A description of the contents, as quoted from the main text of the article, is:

"These datasets and original codes include: DFT output files for convergence to stationary points, vibrational frequency analysis, and intrinsic reaction coordinate analysis; Jupyter notebook and dependences needed to generate thermochemical datasets from DFT outputs; molecular volumes calculated from optimized geometries; MATLAB code for predicting experimental product yields; and SMILES representations of reaction networks."
